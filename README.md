# Munch Mind — Let Your Mood Decide What’s for Lunch!
## 🌟 Inspiration  
These days, choosing what to eat isn’t always easy. We often find ourselves scrolling through endless options, unsure of what truly matches our mood or health goals. Sometimes, we’re just too busy with work or studies to even think about meals—we either skip them or settle for whatever’s convenient.

That’s what inspired us to create **Munch Mind** — a fun, mood-based food discovery app designed to help people eat better, feel better, and enjoy food more mindfully.
